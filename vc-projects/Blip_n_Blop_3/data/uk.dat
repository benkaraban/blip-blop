1^Oh no! The poor old man has been killed!
2^Yeah! Looks like he's been tortured too.
3^Those responsible for this infamy will pay, I swear!
4^Your death will be avenged!
10^The pathetic leader of this bunch of scum is trying to escape.
11^He probably understood he wouldn't stand a chance against us.
12^Let's leave this stinkin' place. I'm sick of it!
13^Who are these guys?
14^We are the Snuff Elite Squad. You won't leave this place alive unless you defeat us!
15^Elite squad, my ass! 
16^Finally... Here's their base.
17^At last! I'm ready for some real action!
18^It's time to use our secret weapon.
19^YOU CAN NOW USE THE COW BOMB!
100^DEFUSE THE 3 BOMBS!
101^2 MORE TO GO...
102^GOTTA KILL'EM ALL!
103^ONE BOMB REMAINING....
104^USE THE SWITCH ON THE RIGHT!
105^GET ON THE LIFT AND 
106^DEFUSE THE BOMB!
107^WELL DONE!
108^NOW KILL THE REST OF THEM!
200^Can't you read? Balls aren't allowed in this club!
201^Sorry teddy, but we have to enter, even if we must kick your sweet ass for it.
202^You fool! I am a Jedi master! The force is on my side!
203^Sure. And the gun is on mine!
204^Hey you! Raise your fucking hands above your head.
205^Let's catch this bastard!
206^GET HIM QUICKLY!
207^I'm the great undead Scare Bears’ ruler! All living creatures are doomed here!
208^Really? I wouldn't bet on it.
209^You! So, you survived the plane attack!
210^What! You were behind this!
211^You brainless ball! This is deeper than you think. You shouldn't have disturbed the high council plans.
212^What plans? What high council?
213^I've wasted enough time with you. So, you won't mind if I leave.
300^I must compliment you. I didn't think you would make it so far. However, your journey ends here. I'll take care of you myself!
301^Fine... I was getting tired running after you!
302^Shit! This fucking shark ate him!
303^And we had to take him alive!
304^What can we do now?
305^Let's finish our job by destroying their base!
306^The Titanic!
307^So, that was them!
308^This time I'm really pissed off!
400^KILL 40 LAMMINGS!!!!
401^We have to hurry! No mercy for those bastards!
402^KILL 60 MORE!!!!
403^YOU HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE!
404^VERY IMPRESSIVE!
405^YOU CAN DO IT!
406^THIS IS REALLY AMAZING!
407^KEEP GOING!
408^WATCH OUT FOR THE LAST ASSAULT!
409^KILL 100 MORE LAMMINGS!!!
410^OH GOD! IT'S A REAL BLOOD BATH!
411^200 LAMMINGS KILLED!
412^YOU DID IT!
413^They killed themselves to avoid facing their own defeat.
414^Yes, we have to admit that these Lammings are indeed worthy foes!
500^Princess Bitch! I should have guessed you were involved!
501^While you were fighting my bold soldiers, the five members of the high council unleashed a terrible assault on the main capitals of the free world.
502^I'm not frightened by these so called members, coz I'm going to kill them anyway.
503^They also destroyed every brewery in the entire world.
504^These members are nuts! You’re gonna pay for what they did!
505^You slut!
506^No, Bitch, princess Bitch!
507^Just shut the fuck up!
520^I'm pretty sure this is the entrance to the high council headquarters.
521^It is indeed! But you won't enter! You must not disturb the masters!
522^The masters? Tell us who they are or we're going to kick your ass!
523^You don't stand a chance, because I'm one of them. I'm known as the Dorkemons’ trainer.
524^Ok, let's kick their asses first then!
525^Lazy artists... It really pisses me off!    
526^These guys have no respect for anything at all!
600^How did you enter? What have you done to my husband?
601^Looks like you've recently divorced.
602^You are not welcome here!
603^You!
604^Yes it is I! Dario! Dario the plumber!
605^I would never have thought a stupid plumber would make such a mess...
606^After many years fixing broken toilets for appalling wages, I had had enough. Naturally I then planned to take over the world, so I created the high council with the help of my brother!
607^You should have stayed in your toilets in the first place.
608^That's where you belong, you piece of shit.
609^How dare you say that to the future ruler of the world?! I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands!
610^Dario, let me take care of these bastards!
611^Yeah, sure! Once you've killed them, go to the Big Mama's place. I'll be expecting you there.  
612^And what's coming next?
613^Let me guess... A hedgehog?
614^That's what I call fate...
615^Hedgehogs always die under the wheels of a car.
700^There's no escape for you this time!
701^What did you expect by hiding yourself here?
702^You're clueless. I'm not trying to escape or to hide. I'm about to reach my goal.
703^You're insane. Your armies are all destroyed; the high council is no more. What can you do on a useless stone drifting in space?
704^Drifting? Not for long, I'm going to change its course in order to strike planet earth itself!
705^You mean... you're going to destroy the whole planet?
706^Yeah! Since I'll never be the ruler of this world, I'm going to destroy it.
707^You're totally insane!
708^Hey, that's cool! Today, we're going to save the world!
